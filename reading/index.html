If you think you should have a blog but you don’t yet, I feel like you will benefit greatly from this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2016/06/15/book-procrastination/">Procrastination: Why You Do It, What to Do About It Now</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 15, 2016</span><br/> If you’re bothered by the endless projects, or many unfinished tasks on your to-do list, this book is great. It addresses very many types of syndromes our busy minds are dealing with. It’s a mediacally-backed book and it gives some good hints on how to deal with procrastination. This booked helped me understand some procrastination elements I noticed in myself.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2016/06/04/book-747/">747</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 4, 2016</span><br/> Great take on what made 747 fly and why. Technical and social challenges at Boeing, metals, structure, plane building and architecture. All of these topics are here. It get quite technical. If you have an interest in aviation industry, this book is for you.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2016/05/18/book-launch-id/">Launch It</a><br/> <span class=date>May 18, 2016</span><br/> If you’re interested in promoting yourself in the Internet through some form of audio/video recordings, this book might be for you.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2016/01/15/book-on-writing-well/">On writing well</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 15, 2016</span><br/> On my blog and through these recommendations I try to practice English, and the “On writing well” was very helpful for improving how I write and how I communicate.

So if you feel like you’re just starting up with agile or you’re not a technical person and you need direct advice wrt. software engineering/IT/support for agile, this book is for you. Value and storytelling are very well done here. Reminded me: “The Goal”.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/11/13/book-the-everything-store/">The Everything Store</a><br/> <span class=date>Nov 13, 2015</span><br/> Dark background behind Amazon and its success. I liked it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/11/03/book-jony-ive/">Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple’s Greatest Products</a><br/> <span class=date>Nov 3, 2015</span><br/> Jony Ive is someone who I, as a amateur designer, envy. And the design world envies. It was cool to learn more about him in a structured form. If you’re a design junkie, you’ll like this one.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/10/24/book-miles/">Miles</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 24, 2015</span><br/> Probably the best audiobook I’ve listened.

Like imersing yourself with things you study about and making sure you keep recalling/using them often.

What sucked a bit is the lack of essence – the summary. You’ll listen through it, but you’ll need to summarise it yourself.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/09/15/book-total-recall/">The Total Recall</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 15, 2015</span><br/> This is absolutely marvelous book on Arnie and if you like biographies of any kind, you’ll just love it as much as I did.

If you’ve read “The goal” or “The Toyota Way” I don’t think you’ll learn anything new. If you haven’t however, this might be a good position.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/07/24/book-from-zero-to-one/">From Zero To One</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 24, 2015</span><br/> This book talk about entrepreneurship in a big sense. How to get from really, really small to gianormous. And how to do it without other people noticing, so that you can be a dominant player.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/06/25/book-hard-thing-about-hard-things/">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 25, 2015</span><br/> Book which I prefer much more than “Zero to One”, as it’s written by the guy who went through many, many obstacles and try to make it through.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/06/14/book-21-dog-years/">Twenty-one Dog Years: Doing Time at Amazon.com</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 14, 2015</span><br/> Very funny take on one person’s career at Amazon from the time of its hypergrowth.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/05/20/book-organized-mind/">Organized mind</a><br/> <span class=date>May 20, 2015</span><br/> Very looong and disorganised book on organised mind.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/05/18/book-just-my-type/">Just My Type</a><br/> <span class=date>May 18, 2015</span><br/> Very nice and compact introduction to typography.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/04/24/book-made-it-stick/">Made it stick</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 24, 2015</span><br/> How to study effectively.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2015/04/23/book-innovators/">The Innovators</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 23, 2015</span><br/> How to innovate and issues during innovation process.

Get it if you like Ruby</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/11/04/book-idea-factory/">The Idea Factory</a><br/> <span class=date>Nov 4, 2014</span><br/> This was an extremely long book on Xerox PARC. I felt like it should have been compressed, since in the audiobook format it was really, really long.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/10/19/book-the-power-of-twitter/">The Power of Twitter</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 19, 2014</span><br/> Book is good if you want to get better at using Twitter and figuring out the dynamics and what it’s all about.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/10/13/book-how-to-read-a-book/">How to read a book?</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 13, 2014</span><br/> Sounded cool, but I couldn’t really find a good way to summarise it. I don’t remember much from this book after two years from reading it. Worth skipping.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/09/24/book-why-rightbrainers-will-rule-the-world/">A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 24, 2014</span><br/> Very cool book, highly recommended. If you’ve ever wondered where the software engineering is going and what’s the connection between engineers and designers, this book might be for you.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/09/17/book-linchpin/">Linchpin</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 17, 2014</span><br/> Don’t remember anything from this book. I think you may skip it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/09/03/book-accelerated-learning-techniques/">Accelerated learning techniques</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 3, 2014</span><br/> Don’t like things from Brian Tracy, but this book was interesting. If you’re a learning geek, get it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/08/28/book-the-minimalists/">Essential: Essays by The Minimalists</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 28, 2014</span><br/> This was the same thing repeated over and over. I’ve listened to the audiobook and had a feeling the book was not really well designed. I like these guys and I like the idea, but this book feels like it needs more work.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/08/21/book-are-you-smart-enough-to-work-for-google/">Are you smart enough to work at Google?</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 21, 2014</span><br/> This was a book on Google values, but don’t remember the details.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/08/12/book-one-minute-millionaire/">One Minute Millionaire</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 12, 2014</span><br/> Don’t remember anything from this book.

Might not be worth buying.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/06/25/book-i-hate-people/">I hate people</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 25, 2014</span><br/> Office survival guide. <br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/06/14/book-im-feeling-lucky/">I’m Feeling Lucky</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 14, 2014</span><br/> This is a story on how Google came to be. It was a very nice personal documentary as well.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/06/07/book-david-and-goliath/">David and Goliath</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 7, 2014</span><br/> How smaller competitors can win the fight over the product/market. Worth read.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/06/02/book-4hr-workweek/">The 4-Hour Workweek</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 2, 2014</span><br/> Tim had a very successful company selling suplements, and wrote a book how to live once you get wealthy. Many people like this book, but I didn’t get it. Valuable thing was talking about trying to automate tedious tasks in your life and spend your time better. But as far as I remember, the actual problems meeting the entrepreneur aren’t discussed in this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/05/29/book-the-real-book-of-realestate/">The real book of real-estate</a><br/> <span class=date>May 29, 2014</span><br/> Another book from “The rich dad” franchise. Don’t remember much from it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/05/24/book-people-are-idiots/">People Are Idiots and I Can Prove It!</a><br/> <span class=date>May 24, 2014</span><br/> Meh. Interesting as audiobook just because it was read by the author and his style was less formal than usual. And because I got it free. Maybe I’m biased. Not worth reading.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/05/14/book-billionaire-and-a-mechanic/">The Billionaire and the Mechanic</a><br/> <span class=date>May 14, 2014</span><br/> I really liked this gem. The title reflects it all.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/05/02/book-the-art-of-start2/">The art of start</a><br/> <span class=date>May 2, 2014</span><br/> Don’t remember much, but it was a bootstrapping guide. Nothing else to add after two years from reading it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/05/02/book-checklist-manifesto/">The checklist manifesto</a><br/> <span class=date>May 2, 2014</span><br/> How using a checklist can be a good way of solving problems in difficult moments.

Title is definitely sketchy, even for my taste. Unclear.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/03/23/book-extreme-toyota/">Extreme Toyota</a><br/> <span class=date>Mar 23, 2014</span><br/> This is “The Toyota Way” rephrased. I think the general rule is: pick just want book about Toyota production system and you’re good to go.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/03/14/book-screw-business-as-usual/">Screw business as usual</a><br/> <span class=date>Mar 14, 2014</span><br/> Great autobiography. Next to “Miles” it’s probably one of the most colorful books I’ve read. Also very good study guide for business people.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/03/08/book-father-son-co-my-life-at-ibm/">Father &amp; Son – my life at IBM</a><br/> <span class=date>Mar 8, 2014</span><br/> On scaling IBM. It’s a good read, since many people consider Thomas Watson Jr to be one of the best corporate leaders.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/03/01/book-direct-from-dell/">Direct from Dell</a><br/> <span class=date>Mar 1, 2014</span><br/> Interesting read on how one of the biggest companies went from 0 to getting public. Funny to read all about this effort and knowing Dell went back private not so long ago. Book was cool – two years after reading it I sometimes come back to it in my head.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/02/21/book-ben-and-jerry/">Ben and Jerry</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 21, 2014</span><br/> Take on how ice-cream we all like got made. From 0 to Cookie Dough icecream!</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/02/17/book-crossing-the-chasm/">Crossing the chasm</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 17, 2014</span><br/> This book is similar to “The Innovator’s Dillema”. Basically what is the life-cycle of the high-tech product and how it’s getting adopted.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/02/07/book-the-power-of-habit/">The Power of Habit</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 7, 2014</span><br/> Great book on achieving success in various domains thanks to the proper habit formation. You figure out the target, you form a habit which gets you to the target closer by small step and you stick to it. And the science behind all that. Worth read.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/02/03/book-blink/">Blink</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 3, 2014</span><br/> How quick assessment and first impression really does count.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/01/22/book-dreaming-in-code/">Dreaming in code</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 22, 2014</span><br/> Two years after reading this book I don’t remember anything from it, so I’d think twice before investing your time in it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/01/16/book-17-undis-laws-of-teamwork/">The 17 Indisputable Laws of Teamwork</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 16, 2014</span><br/> After 2 years from reading I don’t remember anything from this book. I guess it wasn’t that valuable.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2014/01/10/book-innovate-like-edison/">Innovate like Edison</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 10, 2014</span><br/> Funny. This book shows Edison like a true grand master of innovation. I guess it’s well deserved, yet a lot of people know that Tesla was invention hero. Ready this book, but read something on Tesla too.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/10/02/book-suz-orman-books/">Suze Orman books (9 steps, Courage…, )</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 2, 2013</span><br/> Probably the best thing that happened to me was picking up these books, since they talk about investment elements which are different from my native country, Poland. A lot of people claim Orman isn’t actually backing her books in the real life, but I never investigated. Nothing in this book is sold to you.

Read “Getting things done”. This book isn’t a good investment.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/09/21/book-guerilla-business-school/">Guerilla Business School</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 21, 2013</span><br/> Don’t remember much from it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/09/14/book-coping-with-difficult-people/">Coping with difficult people</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 14, 2013</span><br/> Don’t remember much from it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/09/10/book-as-i-see-it/">As I see it.</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 10, 2013</span><br/> Another really great biography.

I’d have to re-read these books once again. I remember reading them one after the other, and they appeared to be very similar.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/08/27/book-envisioning-information/">Envisioning information</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 27, 2013</span><br/> If you’re a UX/UI designer, this would be a must-have book. I found its look very appealing. Tufte created a great style for this book. But content I’ve found hard to digest. I get the concepts, but reading was a chore, since the nomenclature and the way he phrases things is very “liberal arts”.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/08/20/book-made-in-america/">Made in America</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 20, 2013</span><br/> One of the best books I’ve read.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/08/13/book-netscape-time/">Netscape Time</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 13, 2013</span><br/> Creation of the legendary web browser and a personal take on Clark’s life. Really great book–highly recommended.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/08/03/book-autobiography-of-andrew-carnegie/">Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 3, 2013</span><br/> Really long book. Got lost many times during listening of an audiobook. Similar format to “The first tycoon” on Vanderbilt. These books are too long and cover too many things. I feel like it’s only interesting if you’re a history junkie.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/07/22/book-brian-tracy/">Brian Tracy books…</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 22, 2013</span><br/> Don’t remember them much. I don’t think these are worth reading.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/07/15/book-mental-toughness/">Mental toughness training</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 15, 2013</span><br/> The only thing I remember from this book is how sports can be mentally challenging, since as you get closer to winning, you’re more stressed out about loosing. And that’s when the control comes into the play for people advanced in the art of sports. Interesting. I keep coming back to it when people make fun out of golf.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/05/15/book-the-millionaire-mind/">The Millionaire Mind</a><br/> <span class=date>May 15, 2013</span><br/> Very interesting take on the finances in the USA. Mentions approaches used by financially capable people to retain wealth. Interesting read.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/05/14/book-jack-straight-from-the-gut/">Jack - Straight from the Gut</a><br/> <span class=date>May 14, 2013</span><br/> This was a real gem. I keep coming back to this book in my head. Should allocate some time and re-read it once again.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/05/10/book-microisv/">MicroISV</a><br/> <span class=date>May 10, 2013</span><br/> Don’t remember much from this book 3 years after reading it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/05/04/book-long-walk-to-freedom/">Long Walk to Freedom</a><br/> <span class=date>May 4, 2013</span><br/> Probably one of the best audiobooks I’ve listened to. Choice of the narrator with a South African accent was excellent. The narrator did an amazing job too. Story is pretty unique and I can highly recommend this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/05/02/book-the-power-of-less/">The Power of Less</a><br/> <span class=date>May 2, 2013</span><br/> This was something between minimalism (and was better than “The minimalists” book) and “Getting things done”. Enjoyed it. Looking back on how many comments I wrote on this book, I feel like it’s a worth read, as it triggered a lot of thinking.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/30/book-learning-node/">Learning Node</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 30, 2013</span><br/> My detour to understand Node more. I have a mixed feeling about this book. I feel like too many topics and frameworks have been touched in this text, so it’s more of a breath read than a depth read.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/28/book-how-to-get-rich/">How to Get Rich</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 28, 2013</span><br/> This was a biography of Felix Dennis and his creation of his publishing empire. A lot of funny moments, and his epic table with ‘comfortably poor’ scale.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/26/book-how-to-be-rich/">How to Be Rich</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 26, 2013</span><br/> This was a really, really great book from one of the America’s best entrepreneurs of that time and the founder of the “Getty’s Museum”. Enjoyed every single minute of it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/23/book-the-art-of-start/">The Art of Start</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 23, 2013</span><br/> Not sure about this one. Didn’t remember much from it. It’s short, so maybe you can read it through your public library first?</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/20/book-succeeding-as-first-time-manager/">Succeeding as first time manager</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 20, 2013</span><br/> Nice little book.

I’m into history of the American business, so not sure if you’d like it. But if you are, I can recommend.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/03/book-ignore-everybody/">Ignore Everybody</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 3, 2013</span><br/> Don’t remember anything about this one</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/04/01/book-what-would-google-do/">What would Google do?</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 1, 2013</span><br/> Yet another Google book</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/03/24/book-javascript/">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a><br/> <span class=date>Mar 24, 2013</span><br/> This book shows old Javascript.

Helped me to get started with this weird bracket syntax and general language concepts. Worked fine for me – the first time LISPer.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/02/23/book-100-startup/">$100 startup</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 23, 2013</span><br/> The art of starting small.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/02/16/book-losing-my-virginity/">Losing My Virginity</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 16, 2013</span><br/> This is a 13+ book, so don’t screen if you find it on your kid’s bookshelf. Branson’s take on this entrepreneurial journey. Found it pretty enjoyable. Unique part about him is that he’s British – most of the other stuff on my list is all Silicon Valley centered.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/02/10/book-how-to-stay-motivated/">How to stay motivated</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 10, 2013</span><br/> Don’t remember exact details when writing this review 4 years after I listened to the book, but I remember having a lot of fun deciphering his accent and jokes.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/02/02/book-dec-is-dead-long-live-dec/">DEC is dead.

I did that too, but I guess Amazon is a modern way of exploring book resources, so feel free to skip this one.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/01/13/book-on-the-roll/">On A Roll</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 13, 2013</span><br/> Author guides us through his life from a NYC hot-dog stand to going public and then buying back the company back. Really enjoyed it. Get it only if you like biographies and analysis from the battlefield.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/01/10/book-50-prosperity-classics/">50 Prosperity Classics</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 10, 2013</span><br/> Dry in the content, but let me pick some positions which I wouldn’t have known if I hadn’t read (listened?) to think book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/01/07/book-automatic-millionaire/">The Automatic Millionaire</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 7, 2013</span><br/> Another position that got me interested in investments. I should revisit that. For the modern adult I’d consider this book a must-have.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/01/04/book-talent-is-overrated/">Talent is overrated</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 4, 2013</span><br/> Explanation why hard and systematic work is really what matters more than “talent”</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2013/01/01/book-6-thinking-hats/">Six thinking hats</a><br/> <span class=date>Jan 1, 2013</span><br/> I was very sceptical, but I’ve played with some exercises in my head, and I believe there is something to the theory of coldly analysing, gather ideas, then colding analysing, then turning feelings back and criticising etc. The idea of a book which gives you hints to get more creative is something I liked. Looking back, I don’t regret having read it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/31/book-no-asshole-rule/">No asshole rule</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 31, 2012</span><br/> If you have social problems at your workspace this book can be helpful for you to gain more perspective and maybe even pinpoint problems.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/29/book-peopleware/">Peopleware</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 29, 2012</span><br/> Art and science of keeping people away from the burnout syndrome.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/27/book-101-secrets-of-highly-effective-speakers/">101 Secrets of Highly Effective Speakers</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 27, 2012</span><br/> Tips and tricks for speakers. Judging by the number of notes I put down after original reading, I suspect I should revisit this book at some point.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/20/book-the-goal/">The Goal</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 20, 2012</span><br/> This is a very unique book, since the author did a great job at making education fun. He grabbed the Agile practices and wrapped them in a fictional storyline in a way that made it actually a very interesting fiction book. Go and get it if you’re interested in agile practices (by the way - if you’re not, something isn’t right).</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/15/book-the-22-laws-of-marketing/">The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 15, 2012</span><br/> Must read for everybody. I keep coming back to lessons learned from this book several years after having read it originally.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/12/book-the-one-minute-manager/">The One Minute Manager</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 12, 2012</span><br/> All I remember about this book is that talks about the science and art of delegation, which I think is one of the top factors why some technical contributors fail to properly transition to the role of a manager.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/07/book-the-old-new-thing/">The Old New Thing</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 7, 2012</span><br/> After Joel Spolsky’s writing, Chen writings were among my favorites, as they too gave enough insight into the technical and non-technical stuff. He is a great software engineer and a very good writer too. Can recommend highly enough. By the way – I enjoyed it even though I’m not a Microsoft software stack person.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/12/02/book-the-new-new-thing/">The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story</a><br/> <span class=date>Dec 2, 2012</span><br/> This is a must if you’re interested in a Silicon Valley history.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/11/17/book-positioning/">Positioning</a><br/> <span class=date>Nov 17, 2012</span><br/> If you like watching best TV ads as much as I do, this book would teach you some of the background used by ad film makers. It is also an advertising book to some extent, and I remember having a lot of fun reading it.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/11/12/book-homepage-usability/">Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed</a><br/> <span class=date>Nov 12, 2012</span><br/> Scrolled through this book, but haven’t read it. Most of the website presented there are out of date with things you no longer see in the web. Haven’t learned much, but maybe because it wasn’t my first book on usability.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/11/07/book-hdl-chip-design/">HDL Chip Design</a><br/> <span class=date>Nov 7, 2012</span><br/> Worth read, but by no means a comprehensive introduction to chip design or Verilog.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/10/25/book-winning/">Winning</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 25, 2012</span><br/> Probably as important for the future leader as “High Output Management”. I remember enjoying this book greatly.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/10/20/book-the-field/">The Field</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 20, 2012</span><br/> Didn’t like it. Too esoteric and sketchy. Skip this one without feeling bad.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/10/14/book-rich-dad-poor-dad/">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 14, 2012</span><br/> Classic.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/10/09/book-little-red-book-of/">Little Red Book of Selling: 12.5 Principles of Sales Greatness</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 9, 2012</span><br/> This was the first book on selling that I read. Looking back and reviewing it after 4 years I don’t remember it much. I should re-read it probably because I’ve read more books by the same author. No strong yes, but not definite no.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/10/07/book-starting-forth/">Starting Forth</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 7, 2012</span><br/> My interest in Forth started from attending Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group meetups at Stanford, and it continued every since. I always appreciate beautiful minimalistic things that can just do one thing very well and do it with minimal resources. And I think this is what Forth is all about. This book is a very gentle introduction into Forth.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/10/02/book-emyth-revisited/">The E-Myth Revisited</a><br/> <span class=date>Oct 2, 2012</span><br/> This is probably one of the best entrepreneurial books you can get. If you’re thinking about starting an enterprise of any sort on your own, go and get this one. If I make a list of the most influential entrepreneurial books ever, I think it’ll be high on the list.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/09/29/book-microserfs/">Microserfs</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 29, 2012</span><br/> Eh. Interesting, but don’t feel bad about not reading this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/09/20/book-the-anatomy-of-buzz/">The Anatomy of Buzz</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 20, 2012</span><br/> This is how modern marketing works like, and how word-to-mouth marketing works like. For a person interested in getting stronger at business this might be a useful addition.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/09/17/book-just-for-fun/">Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 17, 2012</span><br/> If you like Linux, this book is for you.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/09/11/book-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance/">The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 11, 2012</span><br/> Not ready to review it yet, I guess. This is a deep book, with a lot of dual meanings of things, and this book is not the best choice for an audiobook..</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/09/07/book-the-tipping-point/">The Tipping Point</a><br/> <span class=date>Sep 7, 2012</span><br/> I write this review 4 years after reading this book, and I think explanation of mavens/connectors is worth reading. After looking through my library I think this book links fairly well with “Innovator’s Dillemma”.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/08/24/book-rework/">Rework</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 24, 2012</span><br/> I highly recommend you skip this book, since I want to be ahead of you.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/08/15/book-getting-things-done/">Getting things done</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 15, 2012</span><br/> This book has helped me with achieving my personal goals and projects. If you have growing Agile board, growing TODO and messy desks and cabinets and you’ll like change some (all?) of those things, I think this book is for you. It’s great. And it’s a very rare I re-read the book to learn more and more, but I did this here. Three times now. I’m going to re-read this book soon too. Go and get it. You’ll benefit.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/08/12/book-how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/">How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 12, 2012</span><br/> Next to Earl Nightingale I’ve known this guy was a big name in the personal-development world, so I went ahead and read it. So-so. If you’re very bored, you won’t loose by reading it. Is it a must-have? Nah.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/08/05/book-how-to-win-friends/">How to win friends and influence people</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 5, 2012</span><br/> This is a good position on soft-skills. Based on the fact that most of the software projects nowadays are too big for a single developer, this is a good book for engineers. It’s not what the title claims it to be – it’s more about human interaction.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/08/03/book-dont-make-me-think/">Don’t make me think</a><br/> <span class=date>Aug 3, 2012</span><br/> This is probably 2nd most important book for UX/UI designers. If you do anything with human-related software and product design, go and read it. It’s a worth investment.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/07/27/book-the-millionaire-next-door/">The Millionaire Next Door</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 27, 2012</span><br/> My interest in investing and personal finance started from this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/07/25/book-anything-you-want/">Anything you want</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 25, 2012</span><br/> Derek Sivers is a pretty influential entrepreneur and a coder. I enjoyed reading his words as much as his code, yet this book is a great read, on par with “Lean Startup” and “Rework”. Go and read. You won’t regret. If I ever make a software startup bootstrapping bible, this book will be somewhere there.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/07/17/book-how-to-move-mount-fuji/">How to move mount Fuji</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 17, 2012</span><br/> I write this review 4 years after reading this book, and the only thing I remember is that it was a pretty good take on Silicon Valley history. You decide.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/07/13/book-best-software-writings/">The Best Software Writing I</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 13, 2012</span><br/> Joel Spolsky is back, but this time as a content moderator.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/07/07/book-the-strangest-secret/">The Strangest Secret</a><br/> <span class=date>Jul 7, 2012</span><br/> This is definitely a self-improvement position, so be warned if you don’t like this kind of stuff. To me this book made a really good positive impact in my life. If you’re reading this review on my website (and you should!) do know I’d not have started my website articles without this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/06/28/book-design-of-everyday-things/">Design of everyday things</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 28, 2012</span><br/> Classing in the UX/UI world. Also must-read for human-facing software engineers. If you built products, tools or any kind of automation solutions, you’d benefit from this book, as it presents an easy-to-understand take on what usability really is.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/06/16/book-getting-to-yes/">Getting to Yes</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 16, 2012</span><br/> This book is useful for people weak at negotiating skills. This book would be great for the engineers working on team projects, since sometimes having a lot of very detail oriented hackers in the room isn’t great for making … any steps towards actual problem resolution.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/06/10/book-more-joel-on-software/">More Joel on Software</a><br/> <span class=date>Jun 10, 2012</span><br/> The “Joel on Software” book and his blog made me order this follow-up. If you read this now or maybe see my other review of “Joel on Software” writings, I think you’ll be fine ordering this position too. It’s basically a printed collection of posts you’d find on Joel’s website for free.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/05/24/book-the-lean-startup/">The Lean Startup</a><br/> <span class=date>May 24, 2012</span><br/> Business classic for software startup bootstrapping. I believe if you plan or think about making your side-projects happen and maybe charge money for those, I think you should invest in this book.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/05/12/book-joel-on-software/">Joel on Software</a><br/> <span class=date>May 12, 2012</span><br/> Spolsky made his mark on the Internet and the software industry with his writing, and there are two ways to access it: his blog or this book. The book has the same stuff, but comes in a handy form. Get it, read it, re-read it many times and assimilate the business/software wisdom. By the way, this is a software startup bootstrapping bible.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/05/05/book-showstopper/">Showstopper!</a><br/> <span class=date>May 5, 2012</span><br/> This book is a great take on the software-engineering, as it explains interactions between people, computers, time and money. If you’ve ever wondered how hard it is to work on big industry projects, this book might be for you.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/04/20/book-hackers_and_painters/">Hackers and painters</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 20, 2012</span><br/> Paul Graham’s classic. Probably must-read if you do anything with computers and programming as your profession.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/04/16/book-the-7-habits/">The 7 habits of highly effective people</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 16, 2012</span><br/> Apparently this a standard item in the Bay Area big corporation’ book-shelf. Some people told me it was handed to them as a standard reading at the new hire training. Are we doomed enough to need books that talk about basic traits of H2H (human to human communication)? Unclear, but reading this one won’t hurt.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/04/15/book-icon/">iCON</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 15, 2012</span><br/> I’ve found this book to be an enjoyable take on leadership within Apple. It gave me background into what Apple products and Steve Jobs was all about back then, when I didn’t even use Apple products at all. Maybe you shouldn’t read it if you want to start using their products one day?</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/04/04/book-the-toyota-way/">The Toyota Way</a><br/> <span class=date>Apr 4, 2012</span><br/> This book is probably the best introduction in the Agile practices there is. It talks about cars, but everything that you read here will make sense for high-tech products. If you substitute “car” with “computer”, this book will make sense and be very enjoyable. It was for me.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/03/27/book-the-soul-of-a-new-machine/">The Soul Of A New Machine</a><br/> <span class=date>Mar 27, 2012</span><br/> If you’re a computer geek like myself, and you like reading engineering post-mortems, this book is for you. Hord of people bunched together to work on the complex engineering product. This will be cool for you, unless you work in tech, in which case better stories you’ll hear from your lab technicians.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/02/10/book-think-and-grow-rich/">Think and Grow Rich</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 10, 2012</span><br/> This is the classic in the genre of self-help and even though the title could be considered very sketchy, a lot of people know and recognize it. It you want to appear cool on the serious party, don’t mention you’ve read it. Unless it’s Silicon Valley – then you’re good.</p> <p><br/> <br/> <a href="/blog/2012/02/02/book-secret/">Secret</a><br/> <span class=date>Feb 2, 2012</span><br/> Dan Harris of ABC News summarized this genre of books accurately, and I think all of us would agree.. Slightly esoteric, but got me started in the personal development field. In my opinion this book changed my life for a plus. Check it out. But be critical.</p> <p><br/> <br/></p> </div> <div class=col-md-1> </div> <div class=col-md-3> <br><h4>Subscribe for updates</h4><p> <div id=mc_embed_signup class=row> <form action="//koszek.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0cfe70aa4cdf848b2adbd70c6&amp;id=bc454f0778" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class=validate target=_blank novalidate> <div id=mc_embed_signup_scroll class=col-md-12> <input type=email value="" name=EMAIL class="required email" id=mce-EMAIL placeholder="Enter E-mail here"> <div id=mce-responses class=clear> <div class=response id=mce-error-response style="display:none"></div> <div class=response id=mce-success-response style="display:none"></div> </div> <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;"><input name=b_0cfe70aa4cdf848b2adbd70c6_bc454f0778 tabindex=-1 value=""></div> <div class=clear><input type=submit value=Subscribe name=subscribe id=mc-embedded-subscribe class=button width="100%"></div> </div> </form> </div> </p> <br><h4>RSS feed</h4><p><a href="http://www.koszek.com/feed.xml"><i class="fa fa-rss"></i>&nbsp;RSS</a></p> <h4>Contact</h4> <a href="mailto:wojciech@koszek.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;wojciech@koszek.com</a><br> <a href="http://twitter.com/wkoszek/"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;@wkoszek</a><br> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/wkoszek/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;LinkedIn</a><br> <a href="http://github.com/wkoszek/"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Github</a><br> <br><h4>Tags</h4> <a href=""><i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;article</a><br> <a href=""><i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;books</a><br> <h4>Links</h4> <a target=_blank href="http://www.barelyusable.com"> <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp; Barely Usable </a><br> <i class="fa fa-fw">&nbsp;</i>(My UX/UI website) <h4>Notes</h4> <a target=_blank href="/notes/software-tools/"> <i class="fa fa-sticky-note-o" aria-hidden=true></i> &nbsp;Software tools</a><br> <a target=_blank href="/notes/great-web-fonts/"> <i class="fa fa-sticky-note-o" aria-hidden=true></i> &nbsp;Great Web Fonts</a><br> <a target=_blank href="/notes/deployment-checklist/"> <i class="fa fa-sticky-note" aria-hidden=true></i> &nbsp;Deployment checklist</a><br> <a target=_blank href="/notes/great-design-examples/"> <i class="fa fa-sticky-note-o" aria-hidden=true></i> &nbsp;Great design examples</a><br> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="col-md-12 footer"> <i>&copy; 2015 Wojciech Adam Koszek (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/wkoszek/">@wkoszek</a>)</i> <br> Visits so far: <script>
